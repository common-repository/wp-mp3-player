WP Mp3 Player is a widgetized audio player for your sidebar. It's easy to setup, and works  with any broswer or device.

== Description ==

*Are you looking for an easy to setup, robust audio player for your sidebar?*

WP Mp3 Player requires no technical knowledge to install, and was built using Anthony Kolber's "audio.js" library so it will work with pretty much any browser or device. It uses html5 native audio wherever supported, and falls back on an invisible flash player anywhere else. It supports .mp3 playlists of up to 50 tracks, and can be styled using standard CSS.

It has been tested with:

* Mobile Safari (iOS 3+)
* Android (2.2+, w/Flash)
* Safari (4+)
* Chrome (7+)
* Firefox (3+, w/ Flash)
* Opera (10+, w/ Flash)
* IE (6, 7, 8, w/ Flash)

New tracks can be uploaded via your WordPress Media library, and then added via the Widget Admin page. 

The HTML is responsive, and will resize to fit any wordpress theme.
